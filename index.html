		<h1>Hello!</h1>
		<p>I am a Chinese girl with a big heart. My philosophy is not to restrict myself on anything, always willing to try and learn, which in a way I can discover and know myself better.</p>

		<p>I grow up far away from my family, which helped me to develop a very independent person with a good problem solving skills. I love making friends, because I always get fascinated by how people can think so differently, and I am always interested to know about different opinions from others. Especially with wise elderly, I love spending them and listening to them, because their words can always motivate and encourage me, and challenge me to think out of box.<P>

		<p> I love nature and appreciate the peacefulness it brings to me. I love lying on the grass and closing my eyes to enjoy the breeze and listen to the nature sounds. I love going to the beach and feel the ocean breeze. I love being around with friends who have positive attitudes towards life and always feel blessed being inspired by them.</p>
