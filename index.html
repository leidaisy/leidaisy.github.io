		<h1>Hello!</h1>
		<p>I am a Chinese girl with a big heart. I enjoy taking challenge and always seeking ways to step out of my comfort zone, because I believe in this way, I can discover and know myself better. I am always seeking ways to better myself.</p>

		<p>I grow up far away from my family, so I developed a very independent personality and problem solving skills. However, the shortage of growing far away from the family is always lacking an mentor, and that’s also why I love making friends, especially those people who has the values that I wish to develop, and luckily, I have made some great friends in my life so far.</P>

		<p>I am an adventurer, I do not like to take people’s words for granted, which mean most of the time, I like to try it myself. The reason, I am doing that is not I do not respect those kind advice, is just the belief of everyone is different, I will and do keep their words in mind, so when I do fail, I will think about their advice again.And due to this belief, I have put myself into lots of interesting experience.</p> 

		<p> I love nature and appreciate the peacefulness it brings to me. I love lying on the grass and close my eyes enjoy the breeze and listen to the nature sounds. I love going to the beach and feel the ocean breeze or going there at sunrise. I love being around with friends who have positive attitudes towards life and always feel blessed being inspired by them.</p>
