	<h2>Portfolio</h2>
	<p>This portfolio is my class project in CPR346-Public Relations Writing and Design class with Dr. Maria Scott. It has the similar content as CPR202 class, which provides us an hands on experience by working with a local non-profit organization. The difference from this project to CPR232 project is this class requires more advanced writing skills, and in addition to that, we are also required to design for the local organization. The organization I am working with called Zen Village, whose vision was to provide an harmonious atmosphere to help people to develop skills and mentality to obtain prosperous life.

	<p>My client is the founder of the organizaition- Master Tsai, and the major concern of my client was to rebrand its image and include more prosperous community members into the target group. </p>
