			<h2>Portfolio</h2>
				<p>This final portfolio compiles all the writing samples and business memos I have done for Americans for Immigration Justice during CPR232 (Public Relations writing and research) with Dr. Splichal. The project requires us making backgrounder, bio, and feature writing for the company we are working for. The reason I chose Americans for Immigration Justice because I am extremely interested in how immigrants can obtain legal protection in the States.

				Their major issue is their publication was not clear about their contribution to the society in terms of figure and the effect they have brought to people’s life. During my time in company, I have suggested them to compile a column on their newsletter or website only for their client to talk about how AI Justice has change their life. Besides those, I have also altered their backgrounder accordingly with emphasize on figures and personal influence. Another issue was lack of membership, which is one of their major income. The content of the old membership letter was very general, didn’t include anything appealing to members personally.After meeting with the communication director and understand most of the members come from their law students or interns. I altered the membership letter with additional personal touch by reflecting their intern experience working with those underserved clients.
