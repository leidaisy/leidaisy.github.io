			<h2>Portfolio</h2>
				<p>This final portfolio includes all my writing samples and business memos I have done during my CPR232 class with Dr. Splichal (Public Relations Writing and Research). With that class, we are provided an opportunity to have a real like experience by working with a local non-profit organization and helping them to improve their public relations material. The company I worked with was Americans for Immigration Justice, whose mission was to obtain and achieve justice for the immigration populations. </p>

				<p>The major concern on the company publications was their material content was too generic, didnâ€™t emphasize on the good, the company has done to the community so far. Which I argued that it buries its major advantage compares with the corporate companies, that they have countless appreciative clients who I believe will be more than willing to write something nice about the company and let the company publicize their materials to increase their public image as a reputable and credible law company to seek. 

				<p> During my time in company, I have suggested them to compile a column on their weekly e-newsletter or website, which designated for their clients to talk about their appreciation towards AI Justice. Besides that, I have also changed their backgrounder that emphasizes more on figures and personal influence. </p>

				<p>The project covers backgrounder, executive bio, Wikipedia  entry, membership letter and feature writings for the company. </p>
